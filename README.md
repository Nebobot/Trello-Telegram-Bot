`telegram_api_token = ""` ‚Äî Telegram API token, received from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

`actions_api = "https://..."` ‚Äî The URL that the bot will access to check for events. For help, see the section [# Trello API](https://github.com/Nebobot/Trello-Telegram-Bot/#trello-api).

`peer_id = 0` ‚Äî ID of the chat where notifications will be sent. You can get this ID yourself if you have already worked with BotAPI. Otherwise, it is recommended to use third-party Telegram clients that have this functionality. For example, Kotogram. If you do not understand anything at all, write an Issue, I will try to explain to you, if needed.

`set_logging = True` ‚Äî Turns additional logs on and off.

### config.py and template_config.py
Configuration variables are available for editing in the `config.py` file. If there is no such file, just rename `template_config.py` to `config.py` and start adding your variables.

### Trello API
For the bot to work, you need to compose the correct actions_api address. You can make it according to this template:
`https://api.trello.com/1/boards/{BOARD ID}/actions?key={API_KEY FROM APP}&token={TOKEN FROM USER}`

### Get BOARD ID
Go to the desired board in Trello, and look at the URL of the page. There is the value you need.

It looks like this:
```
https://trello.com/b/PfDq3BsL/name
                     ^ ^  ^ ^
                     Board ID
```

### Get API_KEY FROM APP
* Go to https://trello.com/power-ups/admin

If you do not understand where the parameters you need are located, refer to the picture below.

### Get TOKEN FROM USER
